    <string name="Spinner_Des">GONAL-f contains a medicine called “follitropin alfa”. Follitropinalfa is a type of “Follicle Stimulating Hormone” (FSH) which
        belongs to the family of hormones called “gonadotropins”. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.\n\n

        In adult women, GONAL-f is used to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment
        with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. Gonal-F is used to treat infertility in women who cannot ovulate. Gonal-F is not effective in women with
        primary ovarian failure (when the ovaries are unable to produce an egg).\n\n

        Gonal-f together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“Luteinising Hormone” or LH) helps release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that are
        not ovulating because their body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).•\n\n

        It also helps develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures
        (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as “in vitrofertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian
        transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”.\n</string>
